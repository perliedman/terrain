# Terrain

This is some experiements and playing with generating procedural terrain. Mostly just re-implementing the work already described here:

* Amit Patel's [Polygonal Map Generation](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/)
* Martin O'Leary's [Generating Fantasy Maps](https://mewo2.com/notes/terrain/)
* Max Ganiev's [Fantasy Maps for Fun and Glory](https://azgaar.wordpress.com/)

The blogs above contain a totally amazing amount of information, great work.
